# Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom Dataset

This repository contains code and documentation for building machine learning models to predict customer churn for a telecom dataset. The project aims to implement and compare four different machine learning models to determine which performs best in predicting churn.

## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for telecom companies to maintain their customer base and improve retention strategies. This project involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
2. **Model Implementation**: Building and evaluating four different models:
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Logistic Regression (LR)
   - Decision Tree (DT)
   - Random Forest (RF)
3. **Feature Engineering**: Feature selection and scaling to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to install the following package:

```bash
pip install M-ana-package
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - The script handles missing values, converts date columns, and creates features related to churn.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Implement and train the following models:
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
     - **Logistic Regression (LR)**
     - **Decision Tree (DT)**
     - **Random Forest (RF)**

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using various metrics and compare their performance.
   - Results are saved
